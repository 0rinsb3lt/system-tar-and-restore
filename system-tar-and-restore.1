.SH NAME
System tar & restore \- Backup and Restore your system using tar or Transfer it with rsync
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
backup.sh  [options]
.sp
restore.sh [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
System tar & restore contains two bash scripts, 
backup.sh
and 
restore.sh.
.sp
The purpose is to make the process of backing up and restoring a full GNU/Linux installation easier,
using tar or transfer an existing installation using rsync.
.sp
Supported distributions: 
.B Arch, 
.B Debian, 
.B Fedora
.SH BACKUP DESCRIPTION
.sp
Backup script makes a tar backup of in a given location. It will make a folder in that location which contains the archive and the log file 
"backup.log" (usefull for tracking tar errors/warnings).

.SH RESTORE DESCRIPTION
.sp
User must create and format partitions using his favorite partition manager before running the script.
At least one root partition is required and optionally a seperate partition for /home, /boot and a swap partition.
.sp
Restore script contains two modes: \fBRestore\fR and \fBTransfer\fR

In Restore Mode, the script uses the above created archive to extract it in user defined partitions. 

In Transfer Mode, the script uses \fBRSYNC\fR to transfer the root filesystem in user defined partitions.

Then generates fstab, rebuilds initramfs image for every available kernel, re-generates locales, installs and 
auto-configures Grub or Syslinux in MBR of given device and finally unmounts and cleans everything.
.sp
log file is saved as /tmp/restore.log

.SH NOTES
.sp
The system that runs the restore script and the target system (the one you want to restore),
must have the same architecture (for chroot to work).
.sp
For booting a 
\fBBTRFS\fR 
subvolumed root successfully with 
\fBSyslinux\fR,
it is recommended to have a seperate /boot partition.
Recommended subvolume name is: __active
.sp
When using \fBLVM\fR, it is also recommended to have a seperate /boot partition. 
.sp
When using \fBRAID\fR, it is recommended to create a seperate raid1 array with metadata=1.0 as your /boot partition. 
.sp
In the target system, in case of \fBSyslinux\fR, old directory /boot/syslinux is saved as /boot/syslinux-old. 
.sp
In the target system, if distribution is \fBFedora\fR and \fBGRUB\fR is selected, old /etc/default/grub is 
saved as /etc/default/grub-old.
.SH EXAMPLES USING ARGUMENTS
.sp
Backup system in the directory /home/john and use 
\fBGZIP\fR 
compression:
.RS 4
\fBsudo ./backup.sh \-d /home/john/ \-c GZIP\fR 
.RE
.sp
Backup system in the directory /home/john, use compression \fBXZ\fR 
and exclude /home directory from backup tarball:
.RS 4
\fBsudo ./backup.sh \-d /home/john/ \-c XZ \-h \-n\fR 
.RE
.sp
Backup system in the directory /home/john, use \fBGZIP\fR for compression 
and keep only hidden files and folders from /home: 
.RS 4
\fBsudo ./backup.sh \-d /home/john/ \-c GZIP \-h\fR 
.RE
.sp
Restore system in /dev/sdb1 partition, using \fBGRUB\fR as bootloader and use
/home/john/Downloads/backup.tar.gz as backup file:
.RS 4
\fBsudo ./restore.sh \-r /dev/sdb1 \-g /dev/sdb \-f /home/john/Downloads/backup.tar.gz\fR
.RE
.sp
Restore system in /dev/sdb1 (root partition), /dev/sdb2 (home partition), /dev/sdb3 (swap partition) 
using \fBsyslinux\fR s bootloader and downloading backup file from ftp server:
.RS 4
\fBsudo ./restore.sh \-r /dev/sdb1 \-h /dev/sdb2 \-s /dev/sdb3 \-S /dev/sdb \-u ftp://server/data/backup.tar.xz\fR

using \fBsyslinux\fR as bootloader and downloading backup file from protected http server.
.RS 4
\fBsudo ./restore.sh \-r /dev/sdb2 \-b /dev/sdb1 \-h /dev/sdb3 \-S /dev/sdb \-u http://server/data/backup.tar.gz \-n user \-p pass\fR
.RE
.sp
Transfer running  system using 
\fBRSYNC\fR.
The root partition partition will be /dev/mapper/debian-root which is a
\fBLVM\fR
partition,
/dev/sdb1 for /boot partition and using
\fBGRUB\fR as bootloader:
.RS 4
\fBsudo ./restore.sh \-r /dev/mapper/debian\-root \-b /dev/sdb1 \-g /dev/sdb \-t\fR
.RE
.sp
Transfer running system using 
\fBRSYNC\fR.
The root partition partition will be /dev/sda2 which is a \fBBTRFS\fR filesystem, /dev/sda1 for /boot partition using \fBSYSLINUX\fR as bootloader.
The root will be in __active subvolume and /usr, /var, /home will be also be in subvolumes:
.RS 4
\fBsudo ./restore.sh \-t \-b /dev/sda1 \-r /dev/sda2 \-S /dev/sda \-R __active \-V \-U \-H\fR
.RE
.sp
Restore system in \fBRAID\fR partitions. The boot partition will be /dev/md0 and the root partition will be /dev/md1.
The backup will be the local file /home/john/Downloads/backup.tar.gz:
.RS 4
\fBsudo ./restore.sh \-r /dev/md1 \-b /dev/md0 \-f /home/john/Downloads/backup.tar.gz \-S /dev/md0\fR
